## Description

_Hello and thank you for viewing 'Galactic Calculator' application! . In this project I demonstrate working with Node and webpack to confiure dependancies along side the package.json to create a live working enviroment. I focus on using test driven development to write this code and test throughly using jest. The application will take in a useres input, and return both the age it would be an another planet as well as your current life expectancy on those planets._
